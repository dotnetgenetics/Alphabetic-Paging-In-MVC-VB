# AlphabeticPagingInMVCVB
An example of creating an alphabetical based paging in ASP.NET MVC VB.NET version.

In order to run this program, open Web.Config file in the root folder and then replace the following values of initial catalog, 
user id and password. Note that I'm using AdventureWorks database as the data source. If not, you may create another Entity model
that connects to your AdventureWorks database and alter some changes in the code.
